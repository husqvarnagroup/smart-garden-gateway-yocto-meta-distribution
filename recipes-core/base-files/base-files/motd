You can find the open source Yocto project for this gateway at
https://github.com/husqvarnagroup/smart-garden-gateway-public
(this does not include the propriety packages, which are needed to
operate the gateway in the smart system).

Please be aware that any modification to your gateway, in particular a
modification of U-Boot, may permanently brick your device and is not
covered by warranty.

Happy hacking!
