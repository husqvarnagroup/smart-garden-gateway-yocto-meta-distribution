You can find the open source parts of the software for this product on
GitHub [1] (this does not include the proprietary packages, which are
needed to operate the gateway in the GARDENA smart system).

Please be aware that any modification to your gateway, in particular a
modification of U-Boot, may permanently brick your device and is not
covered by warranty.

Happy hacking!
